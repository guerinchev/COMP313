## Game: Pacman

### Game Description:

The main action of this game is moving a marble (a.k.a weird pacman) with the W,A,S,D keys to collect pellets and avoid being eaten be even weirder representations of ghosts(thin cylinders in my case). Pacman can eat power pellets which are the larger blinking pellets which makes the ghosts continue following their path instead of following the pacman if they have line of site. Pacman can use the two exits to teleport over to the opposite side of the maze if need be to avoid getting eaten by the ghosts. Pacman has three lives and once he uses them all if not eating all the pellets the game will finish and give the player the chance to replay or end game.
The start screen for the player allows them to either choose settings or start. The setting has one implemented of two options, the resolution option allows the player to choose between two different resolutions.

The most difficult part was getting use to using the behaviour tree, issues with collisions and ghosts getting stuck due to navigation problems(one reason why they are so thin due to the small corridors they have to walk through). Though blueprints are pretty straight forward, understanding the different options/possibilities required quite a few hours watching and reading online. Small problems with assets that would conflict with other assets or certain settings not being permitted also caused delays in finishing this assignment. 

The most interesting part of the game was also the difficult part, tinkering with behaviour trees and creating materials. Joining all the parts to make a final game was quite satisfying. Though I have dabbled with Cryengine and other sandboxs it was interesting to go through the process of actually completing something that worked to a certain degree at a small scale. This endeavour also made me aware of the need to explore more of this area of game making to further my experience and knowledge in order for me to become more proficient at developing games.
